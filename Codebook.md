#Introduction
* The final tidy dataset contains the subject, his/her activities and the average of each mean and standard deviation for each measurement coming from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
* These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
* Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
* Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals. Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm. 
* Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequency.These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern.
* '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
